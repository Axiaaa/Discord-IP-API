## README - Retrieving Information from an IP Address

This project is a Discord bot that allows you to obtain information from a given IP address using the slash command "/ip." It uses the [IP-API.com](IP-API.com) API to fetch information.
It's very simple and primitive but the purpose was just to understand API request and how to use them with Discord bot.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run this bot, make sure to install the [Interactions.py](https://github.com/interactions-py) library using pip. You can do this by running the following command:

```markdown
pip install -U discord-py-interactions
```


## Configuration
Before you can use this bot, you need to obtain a Discord authentication token. You can get one by creating a new bot application on the Discord Developer Portal.

Once you have obtained a token, replace the value of the "TOKEN" variable in the code with your own token. Make sure to keep this token confidential and do not share it publicly.

## Usage
Once you have configured the bot and installed the required dependencies, you can run the bot by executing the file containing this code. The bot will be ready to respond to the slash command "/ip."

To obtain information from an IP address, follow these steps:

Join the Discord server where the bot is deployed or make it join yours.

In a text channel, type the following command:

```/ip [IP address]```
Make sure to replace "[IP address]" with the IP address you want to check.

The bot will respond with the information retrieved from the provided IP address.

This bot is created for educational purposes and should be used responsibly and ethically. It is designed to demonstrate how API can interacts with Discords bots and should not be used for any malicious or harmful activities.
